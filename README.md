# GLM Processing Scripts and Notebooks

## Description
This repository contains my notebooks and scripts for interacting with GLM data. Some of it is very detailed and documented and some of it is not.
I will be in the process of making it such that all of it is documented, and anything that doesn't need to be is removed.

## Dependencies (for the most part)
- [glmtools](https://github.com/deeplycloudy/glmtools)
- [pycubicspline](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/pycubicspline)

## Notes
Some things to note are that there are more things that are necessary than just these. For example, the Google SDK cloud shell is necessary for downloading data.
Other packages that might not be installed might be listed at the top of each file, so I'll be updating the "dependencies."
Some files are very disorganized (good example being the playgrou.ipynb) as they are often environments made to test small things and keep as reference.
Some of the scripts aren't fully updated (for example, the multiprocesing GLM data script works for only groups currently).
